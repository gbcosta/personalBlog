            Hi, my name is Gabriel and I'm a full-stack developer with skills
            in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. I use Node.js for the
            back-end, and I love programming in the terminal using NVIM. In
            addition to web technologies, I also know a bit about C++ and C#,
            and I'm currently learning GOLANG.
